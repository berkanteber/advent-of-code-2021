In part 1, it can be proved mathematically that the ideal position is the median.
Median selection can be performed in O(n) on average with Quickselect algorithm.

In part 2, it can be proved mathematically that the ideal position is very close
(Â± 0.5) to the mean. Knowing that improves upon the brute-force solution a lot.
