In part 1, it can be proved mathematically that the ideal position is the median.
Median selection can be performed in O(n) on average with Quickselect algorithm.

Note that `statistics.median` also sorts data first instead of using an O(n) algorithm,
so using it wouldn't improve the time complexity. However, this issue [1] provides
comparisons of some O(n) median-finding algorithms written in pure Python to
the existing algorithm which sorts in O(nlogn) first but uses C for sorting,
and concludes that O(n) algorithms written in Python do not improve upon the existing.

In part 2, it can be proved mathematically that the ideal position is very close
(Â± 0.5) to the mean. Knowing that improves upon the brute-force solution a lot.
